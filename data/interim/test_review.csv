Acko had cashless tie up with the car service Center. So the work has become very easy. Within 2 days they have inspected the vehicle and gave approval to start the repair work. And as I took bumper to bumper insurance everything was covered including consumables. Only I had to pay the minimal charges of 6000 which was accepted before paying premium itself. And premium was also very low compared to others.,5,0,2.1.4,2020-10-17 12:22:04,"Hey Lokanath, It's a pleasure to know that we could provide you with an excellent service.
